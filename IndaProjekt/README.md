# Bouncin' Bee
  

Bouncin' Bee is a game where you will help Bob the Bee collect nectar from flowers by bouncing on them, since he is too fat to fly from flower to flower. You must help him on his quest to collect nectar, so he will be able to feed his family.  


Bouncin' Bee will be available on Google Play: link here.


We will test the game by playing it on our phones to ensure everything works as intended.
